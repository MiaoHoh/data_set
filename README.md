# Title
A method for evaluating and optimizing the quality of packaging graphic design by integrating visual salience and aesthetic rating.

## Describe
This project aims to develop a methodology for evaluating and optimizing the quality of packaging graphic design based on image aesthetic prediction and visual saliency analysis. The project implements a complete process from image input, saliency extraction, and aesthetic score prediction to joint quality assessment and design optimization.



## Dataset information
A dataset of 400 manually collected packaging design images.

##

## 🧪 Methodology

This project presents a systematic approach for evaluating and optimizing the visual quality of packaging design by combining visual saliency detection and aesthetic score prediction. The framework is built upon U²-Net and NIMA, forming a joint quality assessment pipeline, followed by an optimization module that selects the most effective design layout.

## Usage Instructions

This section provides guidance on how to set up and run the project, as well as how to load the dataset and execute the main modules.

### 1. Install Dependencies

Ensure Python is installed (preferably Python 3.7+), then install all required libraries via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 2. Prepare Configuration

The configuration file is located at:

```
config/config.yaml
```

It defines essential parameters such as:

* Dataset paths
* Model weights
* Training or evaluation settings
* Output directories

You can modify this YAML file to suit your local environment or experiment needs.

---

### 3. Load and Preprocess Data

The data should be placed inside the `data/` directory. Use the provided `data.py` module to load and preprocess the dataset:

```python
from data import load_data

train_data, test_data = load_data(config_path="config/config.yaml")
```

The function will automatically handle normalization, resizing, and batching based on the configuration.

---

### 4. Run the Main Program

To start training, evaluation, or inference, execute:

```bash
python main.py --config config/config.yaml
```

Depending on the configuration, it will call the corresponding modules such as `aesthetic.py`, `saliency.py`, or `optimize.py`.

---

### 5. View Results

After execution, results such as predictions, visualizations, and logs will be saved in the output directory specified in `config.yaml`. You can visualize performance using:

```python
from viz import plot_results

plot_results("path/to/output")
```
